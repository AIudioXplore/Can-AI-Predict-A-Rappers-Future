You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Lyric quality: 3
The lyrics are straightforward, with a catchy and repetitive chorus. However, they lack depth and complexity, relying heavily on shock value and profanity.

Language and wordplay: 2
There is a limited use of wordplay and creative language, with the main focus being on explicit and provocative content.

Originality/uniqueness: 2
While the lyrics are unique in their boldness and vulgarity, they do not stand out as particularly original or innovative within the hip-hop/rap genre.

Memorability: 3
The repetitive nature of the chorus makes it somewhat catchy and memorable, but the overall lack of depth and substance may limit its long-term memorability.

Prediction: No, the artist of these lyrics is unlikely to have a high achievement score three years from now, as the lyrics lack the depth and originality needed to stand out and maintain long-term success in the competitive music industry.
