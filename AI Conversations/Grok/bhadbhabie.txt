You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Oh my God, Ronny

White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bich – hi, bich
Hi, bich – hi, bich
I do not sniff it or roll it (no)
It do not drip when I pour it (no)
I do not run, I reload it (no, no)
I do not save it, I throw it
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bich – hi, bich
Hi, bich – hi, bich

Please stop, please stop, please stop, please stop! (stop that shit)
That fit look like you bought it at a kiosk (was it on sale though?)
And they got the nerve to ask, "why she hot?" (she hot)
Why you countin' all that money that we got?
I ain't worried 'bout no basic bitches
All y'all look like you still fly Spirit
All y'all must not've looked in the mirror
All y'all lookin' but the windows tinted like... (hi, bich)
I don't know what made all y'all haters (hi, bitch)
Play if you want, but you know I ain't playin' like...

White J's, white Porsche

Hi, bich – hi, bich
Hi, bich – hi, bich

I do not save it, I throw it
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bich – hi, bich
Hi, bich – hi, bich

Grown as hell and you still hatin'?
I look at you and thank God, I made it like...
Hi, bich
Hi, bich

Lyric quality: 3/5
The lyrics are catchy and have a certain level of appeal, but they lack depth and are somewhat repetitive. The song seems to focus more on style and attitude rather than substance.

Language and wordplay: 2/5
There is not much wordplay or clever use of language in these lyrics. The rhymes are basic and straightforward, and the lyrics do not showcase any exceptional linguistic skills.

Originality/uniqueness: 2/5
The lyrics do not present anything particularly original or unique. The themes and content are common in many hip-hop and rap songs.

Memorability: 3/5
The song has a catchy hook and a repetitive chorus that may make it memorable for some listeners. However, the overall lack of depth and originality may limit its long-term memorability.

In three years, I predict that the artist will have a moderate achievement score. While the song may be popular due to its catchy nature, its lack of depth and originality may limit its long-term success.
