You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Ayy, if you got your motherfuckin' pepper steppers on, man
Tie them hoes up tight 'til where you got no circulation in your ankles (You can't even walk, nigga)
'Cause, 'cause vibe to the song, man, if you got your shit on, look (For real)

Ayy, if you got that shit on, take it off
Bitch, vibe to the song, from the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip then you dip with the hip-hop
Put this on TikTok, no, not like that, like this, watch
From the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip then you dip with the hip-hop
Put this on TikTok

Flip, flip, flip, run a nigga out his flip-flops
Flop, flop, flop, crack a bitch off a TikTok
Rock, rock, rock, don't stop like you runnin' from the cop, cop, cops
Let this thing pop, pop at the opp, opp, opp
I just got the drop, drop at a nigga drop-drop (Drop, drop)
Stop and roll, grab the pole, let me know what you know

If you got that shit on, take it off
Bitch, vibe to the song, from the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip then you dip with the hip-hop
Put this on TikTok, no, not like that, like this, watch
From the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip then you dip with the hip-hop

Put this on TikTok
Ayy, do your stuff, pick it up, drop it down to the ground
Round for round, pound for pound
Make a sound like this sound - [clapping:]
Round of applause for the cost
Don't worry what it cost, Blueface, baby, I'm a boss
If I lost, take a loss
Get it back, got a crack
Lift that ass with a jack
Put a bitch on her back
That's a fact, I'ma mack
She gon' do it for a stack
Stack it up, stack it up, grey cup, do your stuff
Pussy wet like a tub
We gon' do it in the shower for an hour

From the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip then you dip with the hip-hop
Put this on TikTok, no, not like that, like this, watch
From the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip then you dip with the hip-hop
Put this on TikTok (TikTok)

I'm not quite sure what you're asking for here. Are you looking for an analysis of these lyrics or something else?

Lyric quality: 2
The lyrics are repetitive and lack depth, focusing mainly on a catchy hook and dance instructions. The language and wordplay are not particularly clever or engaging.

Language and wordplay: 1
There is little to no use of wordplay or creative language in these lyrics. The song relies heavily on simple, repetitive phrases.

Originality/uniqueness: 1
The lyrics are not original or unique, as they follow a common theme in contemporary hip-hop and rap music, with a focus on dance and social media trends.

Memorability: 3
The repetitive nature of the lyrics and the catchy hook make them somewhat memorable, but the lack of depth and originality may limit their long-term impact.

Overall, the lyrics score low in all categories, as they lack depth, originality, and creative language.

Based on these lyrics alone, I predict that the artist will not have a high achievement score three years from now. The lack of originality and depth in the lyrics may limit the artist's long-term success. However, this is just a prediction based on the lyrics, and other factors, such as the artist's performance, marketing, and overall musical talent, may influence their future success.
