You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

(Wheezy outta here)

Who you think you're foolin'?
We got new toolies
We kinda fluent
I'm scammin' that work
I come from the mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma get out my problems, above 'em
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love

We don't need no one vouchin' for us
I been grindin' here, found me a buzz
I been searchin' for love and found lust
It's so hard to stop holdin' a grudge
'm on that dance, bitch, I shoot like I dance
My old squad kept the kid in the cut
Keep your strap, 'cause these niggas play tough
Pick and choose who the right one to trust
Pick and choose who the right one to trust
Keep it real, there's a lotta fake love
Niggas hate, but they bitches in love
And the Bentleyall white like a dove
I took off, ate this Xan, means it works
Pay that out or I won't do the verse
I want someone who can tell when it hurt
You can't tell me she ain't a slut

Who you think you're foolin'?
We got new toolies
We kinda fluent
I'm scammin' that work
I come from the mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma get out my problems, above 'em
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love

I don't need no one vouchin' for me
I be flossin', ain't talkin' 'bout my teeth
Car push-start, I keep losin' them keys
Chanel boss, my closet full of C's
My shit wet, Elliante VV's
I got pearls on my neck now, no beads
I get cash in my bank when I'm asleep
New blue-face, two-tone Patek Philippe
Beverly Center, shopping spree on me
New agenda, don't do nothin' free
Ain't no one of my foreigns on lease
All my bitches got expensive weaves
I still strive for my plan to get eased
I still talk to the Lord on my knees
Helpin' me take care all of my needs
And we take off that top for a breeze

Who you think you're foolin'?
We got new toolies
We kinda fluent
I'm scammin' that work
I come from the mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma get out my problems, above 'em
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love

Lyric quality: 4
The lyrics are well-crafted, with a mix of street-savvy language and introspection. The verses show a good balance between bravado and vulnerability, which adds depth to the song.

Language and wordplay: 3
The language is clear and straightforward, but there's not a lot of wordplay or complex metaphors present. However, the lyrics are still effective in conveying the artist's message.

Originality/uniqueness: 3
While the lyrics touch on familiar themes in the hip-hop/rap genre, the artist's personal experiences and perspective add a layer of authenticity that makes the song stand out.

Memorability: 4
The chorus is catchy and the verses have a good flow, making the song memorable. The mix of braggadocio and introspection also adds an interesting dynamic that helps the song stick in the listener's mind.

Yes, I think the artist has a high chance of achieving success in the next three years. The lyrics show potential and the artist's unique perspective, which can help them stand out in the hip-hop/rap scene.
