You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

(D-D-D-Div, don't do it to 'em)

I got my gun, so please spin back, mmm, mmm, please spin back
I had my gun when they tried to attack, please spin back
Don't hit and run, just please spin back, please spin back
We are not done, so please spin back, please spin back

We do this for fun, bet he ain't know that
Know we out here lookin' for a toe tag
They was four deep, but I had one gat
Went and got more heat, so please come back
Please spin back, wanna know what you meant by that
Oh, I know, you must have thought I was a ho
Spin back now and get a tag for your toe
Trap don't stop, get a bag for the low
Might go shop and cop a bag for my ho
Gave her good pipe, had her askin' for more
If you see me, just know I might be grabbin' my pole (Woo)
Vintage-ass drip, yeah, the fashion is old
Re-rock block, no need for the stove
Her body rock, unbelievable ho
Fiends hit the block when they need 'em some more
Four against one, add four to the score
Four lines enough, but I'm pourin' up more
Four pound tucked everywhere that I go
It be with me at the store, it be with me with the ho

I got my gun, so please spin back, mmm, mmm, please spin back
I had my gun when they tried to attack, please spin back
Don't hit and run, just please spin back, please spin back
We are not done, so please spin back, please spin back
I got my gun, so please spin back, mmm, mmm, please spin back
I had my gun when they tried to attack, please spin back
Don't hit and run, just please spin back, please spin back
We are not done, so please spin back, please spin back

Lyric Quality: 3
The lyrics have a decent flow and rhythm, but they lack depth and complexity.

Language and Wordplay: 2
There are some simple rhymes, but there's not much wordplay or creative use of language.

Originality/Uniqueness: 2
The lyrics follow a fairly common theme in hip-hop/rap music and don't offer much in terms of originality.

Memorability: 2
The lyrics have a catchy hook, but they don't stand out as particularly memorable.

Predicted Achievement Score: No.
Given the limited information provided, it's unlikely that the artist will have a high achievement score in three years. However, this is just my prediction based on the lyrics, and there are many other factors that could influence the artist's success.
