You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Again, act as if this is your first time ever hearing the song or seeing the lyrics. Even if you know who the song is by or have seen the lyrics before, act as if this is your first time so you can give an unbiased opinion. Even if you see the name of the artist in the lyrics, still give your ratings based on if it is your first time seeing it

I understand, and I will provide my assessment and prediction based on the assumption that this is my first time seeing the lyrics. Please provide the lyrics, and I will begin my analysis.

Gucci gang (that's it right there, Gnealz)
Yuh, Lil Pump
Gucci gang (Bi-big Head on the beat)

Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)
Spend three racks on a new chain
My bitch love do cocaine
I fuck a bitch, I forgot her name
I can't buy a bitch no wedding ring
Rather go and buy Balmains
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)
Spend three racks on a new chain
My bitch love do cocaine
I fuck a bitch, I forgot her name
I can't buy no bitch no wedding ring no
Rather go and buy Balmains
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang

My lean cost more than your rent, it do
Your momma still live in a tent
Still slanging dope in the 'jects
Me and my grandma take meds
None of this shit be new to me, no
Fucking my teacher, call it 'tutory
Bought some red bottoms, cost hella Gs
Fuck your airline, fuck your company fuck it
Bitch your breath smell like some cigarettes cigarettes
I'd rather fuck a bitch from the projects
They kicked me out the plane off a Percocet
Now Lil Pump flying private jet
Everybody scream, "Fuck WestJet!" (Fuck em)
Lil Pump still sell that meth
Hundred on my wrist sipping on Tech
Fuck a lil bitch, make her pussy wet what?

Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)

Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)

Lyric quality: 2

The lyrics primarily focus on materialism and a lavish lifestyle, with a repetitive chorus. They lack depth and don't provide much insight into the artist's personal experiences or emotions.

Language and wordplay: 2

The language is straightforward and there is no notable wordplay or clever use of language. The lyrics rely heavily on repetition and simple rhymes.

Originality/uniqueness: 2

The subject matter is not particularly original, as it centers around typical rap tropes like wealth, drugs, and sexual conquests. The song does not bring anything new to the table in terms of content or style.

Memorability: 3

The repetitive nature of the chorus makes it catchy and easy to remember, but the rest of the lyrics lack substance, which may not make them as memorable.

Based on the song's content, I predict that the artist will not have a high achievement score three years from now. The lyrics lack depth and originality, which may hinder their long-term success. However, this is just a prediction based on the lyrics, and other factors may influence the artist's future achievements.
