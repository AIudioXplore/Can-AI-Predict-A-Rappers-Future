You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Sugar Trap

(Rule number 1)
Don't worry about a bitch who never been in your place
Always move in silence, never question your fate
(Rule number 2)
Always check in on your niggas, gotta make sure they straight
If I'm getting money, then you know we all got a plate
Since a baby in her tummy, mama knew I was great
They can't play me like a dummy, they know what not to take
Fuck these niggas, cause the money only thing I'ma chase
Time is precious, that's the only thing I try not to waste
She hatin' 'cause I'm up, you can tell on her face
I been eating so much, I've been saying my grace
When the times was rough, I would look up and pray
Thank God I ain't have to smack a bitch today
(Oh my fucking god)

Smack a bitch today
Thank God I ain't have to smack
Yeah
Smack a bitch today
Thank God I ain't have to smack a bitch today
Yeah, whoa

Run up OG when I'm smoking my jay (Yeah!)
New car too fast so i'm winning the race (Ha ha!)
Blast off fast car cool breeze in your face (Whoa!)
Don't hate on me bitch stay in your place (Lame)
"You rap about an Audi too much" (Shut the fuck up)
Because my Audi paid off bitch, hush! (Shut the fuck up)
Why she be yelling so much?
If i see you in the street,
Bitch your ass in done!
I don't need your opinion (I don't need it)
Do what I fucking want (Do what I fucking want)
You such a fucking chump (You such a fucking chump)
Pockets are swoll' lump sum (Damn!)
Bitch you a fucking bum (You a fucking bum!)
See your ass is done (Your ass is done)

Thank god I ain'tâ€“
Thank god I ain't have to smack a bitch today
Catch a case
Punch that bitch right in her face

Yeah!
Sugar trap!

Lyric Quality: 3.5
The lyrics have a mix of braggadocious and introspective elements, but they lack a clear narrative or central theme. The use of profanity and slang may appeal to some listeners, but it might also be off-putting to others.

Language and Wordplay: 2
There isn't much wordplay or clever use of language in these lyrics. The rhymes are straightforward and predictable, with little variation or experimentation.

Originality/Uniqueness: 2
The themes and content of the lyrics are fairly common in the hip-hop genre, and there's not much that sets them apart from other similar songs.

Memorability: 2
The chorus is catchy and easy to remember, but the verses are not particularly memorable due to their lack of depth and complexity.

Overall Score: 2.6

Based on these lyrics alone, I predict that the artist will not have a high achievement score three years from now. However, there are many other factors that contribute to an artist's success, such as production quality, marketing, and live performances.
