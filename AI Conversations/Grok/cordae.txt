You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Uh
Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
New car, speed racin'
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma comin', beware

I don't know where I'm goin' (huh)
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas goin' out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back

There's no complainin' on this side
My niggas, shit is not tolerated
Cut some niggas off like an operation
And my team way more consolidated
Suite presidential, that's inauguration
'Cause we cookin' crack like Ronald Reagan
Chip on my shoulder, boy, I'm not for waitin'
Divine timin', took a lot of patience
Now it's time for the takeover, all gas and the brake's slower
Took a trip out to Tokyo, now I'm here in Paris for the layover
Fuck old niggas, boy, your day's over
You're mad at me because your pace slower
Bitter nigga, you a shade-thrower, I was just sleepin' on a sofa
Now I ride with a paid chauffer
Because I'm way doper, better stay sober
I paint pics 'cause you a Crayola
I got a bad bitch and she laid over
She really asked "'could she stayed over?"
I told her that we needed face closure
This mellow money has a great odor
These the things that I prayed over

Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
New car, speed racin'
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma comin', beware

I don't know where I'm goin' (huh)
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas goin' out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back
(Huh, huh)

Why cry over spilled milk if you still feel I'm the real deal?
My bitch bad with no ill-will 'cause she'll murk a nigga like Kill Bill
Loose slips, sink ships, Cam'ron pink drip, that is my fashion
I'm not really with the high flashin', it's not helpin' with my braggin'
I penetrate it, been the greatest, new house, renovate it
I got the juice you eliminated, pussy-niggas always instigate it
Can't fuck me over, boy, I'm too clever, that applies all to whoever
I'm just here to pursue pleasure, boy, I'm goin' out like Hugh Hefner

Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
New car, speed racin'
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma comin', beware

I don't know where I'm goin' (huh)
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas goin' out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back

(Baby Jesus, please save us)

I have analyzed the lyrics and rated them based on the specified categories:

Lyric quality: 4
The lyrics are well-written and have a good flow. The artist uses metaphors effectively and creates vivid imagery with their words. The lyrics also have a strong narrative and are relatable, which makes them engaging.

Language and wordplay: 4
The artist uses a mix of slang and more formal language to create a unique style. There are clever wordplays and double entendres throughout the lyrics, which add depth and make the song more interesting.

Originality/uniqueness: 3
The lyrics cover familiar themes like success, ambition, and overcoming adversity, which are common in the genre. However, the artist's personal experiences and perspective make the song feel fresh and unique.

Memorability: 4
The catchy hook and strong storytelling make the lyrics memorable. The use of repetition and vivid imagery help the song stick in the listener's mind.

After analyzing the lyrics, I predict that the artist will have a high achievement score three years from now. Their strong songwriting skills and unique perspective suggest that they have the potential to make a lasting impact in the music industry.
