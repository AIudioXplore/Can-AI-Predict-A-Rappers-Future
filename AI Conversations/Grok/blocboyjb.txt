You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Weigh it no Reebok used to wear Fila

Lyric quality: The lyrics of this song have a strong focus on storytelling and personal experience, with vivid imagery and a consistent theme. The use of wordplay and metaphors adds depth to the narrative, making the lyrics engaging and memorable.

Language and wordplay: The song incorporates various forms of wordplay, such as homophones (e.g., "SiLA" and "Coo Coo"), puns, and metaphors, which add to the overall quality of the lyrics and make them more interesting to the listener.

Originality/uniqueness: While the song's subject matter (e.g., drug dealing and street life) is not entirely unique, the artist's personal perspective and storytelling style give the lyrics a distinctive feel. The use of specific brand names and pop culture references also adds a layer of originality to the song.

Memorability: The catchy chorus, with its repetitive structure and rhythmic flow, makes the song easy to remember. The vivid and evocative imagery in the verses also contributes to the memorability of the lyrics.

Based on the above analysis, here are my ratings for each category:

Lyric quality: 4/5
Language and wordplay: 4/5
Originality/uniqueness: 3/5
Memorability: 4/5

As for the question of whether or not the artist will have a high achievement score in three years, it's impossible for me to predict with certainty. However, based on the quality of the lyrics and the potential for the song to be popular, it is possible that the artist could achieve a high level of success in the future.
