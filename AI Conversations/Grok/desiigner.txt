You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Again, give your opinion based on if it is your first time hearing the song. If you know who the artist is or have already seen it, act like you haven't and give your honest opinion. Remember to numerically rate each category I've given you and provide a yes or no prediction based on if you think the artist will be success three years from now given the lyrics of the song I give you.

Lyric quality: 2
The lyrics are repetitive and lack depth, often focusing on material possessions and a flashy lifestyle.

Language and wordplay: 2
There is little use of figurative language or clever wordplay, with many lines being straightforward and simplistic.

Originality/uniqueness: 1
The content and themes of the song are not particularly original, as they focus on common hip-hop tropes such as wealth, cars, and women.

Memorability: 3
Despite the repetitive nature of the lyrics, the catchy "panda" hook and the use of the X6 and Phantom cars as symbols could make the song memorable for some listeners.

Prediction: No
Based on the lyrics alone, I predict that the artist will not have a high achievement score three years from now. The song's lack of originality and depth may hinder the artist's long-term success in the competitive hip-hop landscape.
