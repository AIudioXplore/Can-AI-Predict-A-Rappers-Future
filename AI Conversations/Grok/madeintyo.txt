You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Lyric quality: 3
The lyrics of "K. Swish" are repetitive and lack depth. The song focuses on themes of wealth, power, and sexual prowess, but it doesn't offer any unique or thought-provoking perspective on these topics.

Language and wordplay: 2
The language in "K. Swish" is straightforward and doesn't utilize much wordplay or clever phrasing. The lyrics are simple and don't require much interpretation or analysis.

Originality/uniqueness: 2
"K. Swish" doesn't bring anything new to the table in terms of subject matter or style. The song relies heavily on familiar tropes and themes commonly found in hip-hop and rap music, making it less unique and memorable.

Memorability: 2
While some of the repetitive lines and catchy phrases might stick in the listener's mind, the overall lack of depth and originality in the lyrics makes "K. Swish" less likely to be a memorable song in the long term.

Yes, this artist will have a high achievement score three years from now. This prediction is based on the fact that the song "K. Swish" has a catchy beat and a straightforward, repetitive style, which could appeal to a wide audience and be successful on the charts. However, the song's lack of depth and originality may limit its long-term impact and critical acclaim.
