You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Hunnids on hunnids, nigga, bring out the blue cheese
Red bone bitch, got her trappin' in her two-piece
100 thousand new pieces, gave away the loose-leaf
Balenciaga runners, shit ain't came with no shoe strings
All this damn money on me, keep on having mood swings
New Glock, green dot, sippin' on some clean Wock'
Ran off on the plug, sent my swiper with a green dot
It's up with everybody, we ain't runnin' way from no opp
Got 'em gangsta bitches pull up, flexin' in a droptop
And she get her own bread, nigga (Own bread, nigga)
I just got 20 thousand dollars from a show, don't trip
I'ma put that shit on yo head, nigga
Remember when the bitches used to flex on me
Now I fuck a lot of bitches in my bed, nigga
Ten niggas actin' like they gon' do sum (Hold on)
Now that's ten dead niggas (Ten dead niggas)
Real big business, we ain't playin' on no kid shit
Big, big racks like I got them playin' tennis
Want a million dollars? Nigga, go sell 10 bricks
I know she a ho 'cause she got a second t— (Uh-uh)
I ain't even gon' say dat (Say dat)
I remember ridin' in a Lexus
Now I'm countin' racks inside a Maybach (Skrrt, skrrt)
And we spend money on fast shit, nigga
Took the whole projects to the muhfuckin' racetrack (On God)

Trappin' out a '03, gotta keep it lowkey
Plug just called, he got the pints and a OG

Lyric quality: 3
The lyrics have a consistent theme and structure, but they lack depth and complexity, relying heavily on repetitive phrases and simple rhymes.

Language and wordplay: 2
There's not much wordplay or clever use of language in these lyrics. The vocabulary is limited, and the rhyming scheme is basic.

Originality/uniqueness: 2
These lyrics don't present anything particularly original or unique. The subject matter is typical of the genre and doesn't offer any new perspectives or ideas.

Memorability: 3
The repetitive nature of the lyrics and the catchy hook make them somewhat memorable, but the lack of depth and originality may limit their long-term impact.

Prediction: No
Based on these lyrics alone, I predict that the artist will not have a high achievement score three years from now. While the lyrics have some catchy elements, they lack depth and originality, which may hinder the artist's long-term success.
