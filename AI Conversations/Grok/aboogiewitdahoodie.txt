You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Lyric quality: 3
The lyrics are straightforward, with a focus on the artist's success and lifestyle. There isn't much depth or complexity to the storytelling, but the lyrics do convey the artist's confidence and pride in their achievements.

Language and wordplay: 3
The language used is simple and direct, with some repetition for emphasis. There are a few instances of wordplay, such as "look back at it" and "girls just wanna have fun with me," but overall, the use of language is not particularly unique or creative.

Originality/uniqueness: 2
The themes of the song, such as success, money, and relationships, are quite common in the hip-hop and rap genres. The lyrics don't offer a fresh perspective or unique take on these topics, which makes them less original than other songs in the genre.

Memorability: 3
The song has a catchy hook and some repetitive elements that could make it memorable to listeners. However, the lack of depth and originality in the lyrics might make it less memorable in the long run compared to other songs in the genre.

Yes or No: No
Given the information provided, I predict that the artist will not have a high achievement score three years from now. While the song has some catchy elements, it lacks the depth and originality that could propel the artist to long-term success in the competitive world of hip-hop and rap.
