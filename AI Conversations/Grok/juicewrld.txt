You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
(I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
(Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break
(Were made outta plastic fake)
You made my heart ache
(I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again
(I was tangled up your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

I won't let you forget me

I'm not quite sure what you're asking for. Are you looking for an analysis of these lyrics or something else?

Lyric quality: 4
The lyrics effectively convey the emotional turmoil and heartbreak experienced by the narrator. They are relatable and evoke a sense of empathy from the listener. The use of vivid imagery and metaphors adds depth to the storytelling, making the song engaging and impactful.

Language and wordplay: 3
While the lyrics are well-written and honest, there is not a significant amount of wordplay or linguistic complexity. The focus is more on conveying the emotions and narrative, rather than using intricate language or clever wordplay.

Originality/uniqueness: 3
The theme of heartbreak and the struggle to move on is a common one in the Hip-Hop/Rap genre. However, the lyrics do offer a personal perspective and touch on specific details that make the song unique to the artist's experience.

Memorability: 3
The chorus and some of the more emotionally charged lines are likely to stick with listeners, but the overall memorability of the song may be somewhat limited due to the lack of standout wordplay or unique lyrical elements.

Based on the lyrics alone, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether the artist will have a high achievement score three years from now. However, if the artist continues to produce emotionally resonant and relatable content, they may have a good chance of achieving success in the future.

Yes, I believe the artist has a good chance of achieving a high achievement score three years from now based on the potential of their lyrics.
