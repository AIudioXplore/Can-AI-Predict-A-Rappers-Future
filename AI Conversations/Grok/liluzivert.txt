You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite alright
And my money's right
8, yeah
Countin' them bands all way to the top, 'til they be fallin' over
Countin' them bands on my way to the top, 'til we fallin' over

I don't really care if you cry
On the real you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to, die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Phantom that's all red
Inside all white
Like something you ride a sled down
I just want that head
My Brittany got mad
I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stacking my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like "Come on over"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me
I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane yeah
I might blow my brain out
Xanny help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it, I swear that it's slowing me, yeah

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "I am not afraid to, die"
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em
Medicine, little nigga take some
Fast car, Nascar, race 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas
Got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G, though
Looking at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was counting that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

She say, "You're the worst, you're the worst"
I cannot die, because this my universe

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to, die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Lyric quality: 3.5/5
The lyrics have a decent quality with some interesting lines and a clear narrative. However, there are moments where the lyrics feel a bit repetitive or lack depth, which could be improved upon.

Language and wordplay: 3/5
There are some clever lines and wordplay in the lyrics, but it's not particularly consistent throughout the song. The language is straightforward and could benefit from more creative use of words and metaphors.

Originality/uniqueness: 3/5
The song touches on themes of success, money, and relationships, which are common in the hip-hop/rap genre. While it does have its own unique elements, it doesn't stray too far from the typical subject matter.

Memorability: 3/5
The chorus is catchy and has a good hook, which could make it memorable. However, some of the verses could be more memorable and impactful with more creative language and wordplay.

Overall, the song has potential but could use some improvement in terms of originality and language.

As for the artist's future success, it's difficult to make a definitive prediction based on these lyrics alone. However, if the artist continues to grow and develop their style, they could have a high achievement score in three years.

Answer yes or no ONLY for the prediction. There is no other option, you must only answer from those two based on your opinion
