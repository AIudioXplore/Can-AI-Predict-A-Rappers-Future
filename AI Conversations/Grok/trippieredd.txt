You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Ooh, so they think I wanna die, yeah
'Cause my doors are suicide, yeah
Bet my coffin would be nice, yeah
Stud that bitch up with some ice, yeah
These people don't want me alive, no
They wanna play games with my life, oh
The coupe doors are suicide, oh
The coupe doors are suicide, oh-ah

Said I hope you got my note bitch
Ayy, I left it on the suicide door bitch
Yeah, and you left it on the floor bitch
Ayy, rule number 1 never trust no bitch
Get this green then smoke this green, gotta stay potent
Pussy nigga talking shit but he ain't know shit
Chicken noodle ass nigga, man, you boneless
Yeah, I keep my ratchet, boy, you pole-less
Wayy, throwing bands tonight
Throwing bands tonight, shawty throwing bands tonight
Throwing bands tonight, huh

Ooh, so they think I wanna die, yeah
'Cause my doors are suicide, yeah
Bet my coffin would be nice, yeah
Stud that bitch up with some ice, yeah
These people don't want me alive, no
They wanna play games with my life, oh
The coupe doors are suicide, oh
The coupe doors are suicide, oh-ah

Lyric Quality: 2
The lyrics are short and repetitive, with a focus on a single theme of defiance and self-importance. While the lines are simple, they do convey a sense of confidence and attitude that is appropriate for the Hip-Hop/Rap genre.

Language and Wordplay: 2
There is minimal wordplay in these lyrics, with the main focus being on rhyming words like "die" and "suicide." The language used is straightforward and lacks depth or complexity.

Originality/Uniqueness: 1
These lyrics do not offer anything particularly original or unique. The theme of defying critics and enemies is common in Hip-Hop/Rap music, and the lyrics do not present a fresh take on the subject.

Memorability: 1
Due to the repetitive nature of the lyrics and the lack of depth or complexity, it is unlikely that these lyrics will be particularly memorable.

In conclusion, the overall score for this song is 1.5 out of 5.

Will the artist have a high achievement score three years from now?
No
