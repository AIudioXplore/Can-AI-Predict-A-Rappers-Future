You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Lyric quality: 4
The lyrics are well-written and flow smoothly, with a consistent theme and narrative. The repetition of "I would give you the world" and "you just gotta be worth it" creates a catchy hook that is easy to remember. The lyrics also show a personal side of the artist, talking about their relationship and their journey to success.

Language and wordplay: 3
There is not a lot of complex wordplay or use of metaphors in these lyrics. However, the language is straightforward and relatable, making it accessible to a wide audience. The lyrics are simple yet effective in conveying the message of the song.

Originality/uniqueness: 3
The theme of the song, a love interest being worth the world, is not particularly original or unique. However, the lyrics are personal and specific to the artist's experiences, which adds a level of authenticity and uniqueness to the song.

Memorability: 4
The catchy hook and simple, repetitive structure make these lyrics memorable and easy to sing along to. The use of "oh, oh, oh" and "nah, nah, nah" also adds to the memorability of the song.

Based on the given lyrics and genre, I predict that the artist will have a high achievement score three years from now. The song is well-written and has a catchy hook, which is important for success in the Hip-Hop/Rap genre. However, there are many factors that contribute to an artist's success, and it is difficult to predict with certainty.
