You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

(Jayron made that right)

I don't know what's goin' on
I'm gettin' to the racks, now that nigga call me "Bro" (Nigga call me "Bro")
Now they pull up to my show (Now they pull up to my show)
I'm just doin' me, they comparin' all my flows (They comparin' all my flows)
And they don't even know (And they don't even know)
And you don't even know, and we don't even know
I just know I'm 'bout to blow, I just know I'm 'bout to glow

Shout out to my nigga Vell (Yeah), yeah, you know he from the North
Got your bitch, she on my body and she sucking me on soft
Why these niggas talking hot? Boy, you know that you ain't tough
Nigga, I ain't gon' lie, got me really fucked up, really fucked up
Really fucked up, really fucked up
Got me really fucked up, really fucked up
Really fucked up, really fucked up
Got me really fucked up (Brrt)

I swear, I don't fuck with these niggas (Nah)
I'm tired, I act like I fuck with these niggas (Nah)
It's like, 'cause they ain't get fake, I get bigger (Nah)
Sometimes I don't even wanna get bigger
I remember when I didn't look in the mirror
Now I see I'm the man when I look in the mirror (Oh, I'm the man)
Are you really the man that you see in the mirror?
Is that really your gang? Did they help you get here? (Help you get here)
And the fit gon' drip, it don't matter what I wear
I could wear a Nike sweatsuit with a Moncler (With a Moncler)
And it's gon' be angelic as long as I'm here
They say "Lil Tecca, what style in your hair?" ("What style in your hair?")

And a shawty on my body, I don't even want her (Want her)
Real cold outside, I ain't even gon' burr (Fuck that)
Found out that some niggas, they be using me for clout, yeah
Pull up on your block, all my niggas gon' skrt

Shout out to my nigga Vell (Yeah), yeah, you know he from the North
Got your bitch, she on my body and she sucking me on soft
Why these niggas talking hot? Boy, you know that you ain't tough
Nigga, I ain't gon' lie, got me really fucked up, really fucked up
Really fucked up, really fucked up
Got me really fucked up, really fucked up
Really fucked up, really fucked up
Got me really fucked up

Here are the ratings for the given lyrics:

Lyric quality: 3
The lyrics are decent, but they lack a strong narrative or theme, and they don't showcase a wide range of vocabulary or complex wordplay.

Language and wordplay: 2
There is not much wordplay or clever use of language in these lyrics. The language is straightforward and simple.

Originality/uniqueness: 2
The lyrics don't present any particularly original ideas or unique perspectives. The content and themes are common in the genre.

Memorability: 2
The lyrics are not particularly memorable due to their lack of unique content, catchy hooks, or standout lines.

Based on these lyrics alone, I predict that the artist will have a moderate achievement score three years from now. However, success in the music industry depends on many factors, including the artist's overall talent, the quality of their music production, their ability to connect with their audience, and their marketing and promotion efforts.
