You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Pop the trunk I open up I sold my soul for a good price
Outta' sight, and my hoe got talent right
Whole squad ran through that shit yikes
What can I say I'm a business man I did my business damn
But I'mma bend it down and I'mma lick her up, then dick her down
She gon' turn around then I'm gon' kick her out
She gon' talk that shit but say
How you make it up, how you fake a love?
Holy son, I was the chosen one
I'm sippin' out the grail, she don't kiss and tell
She keep my wishes well I don't need her, well
How my enemy a friend of me?
Why ya'll feed off of my energy, like I ain't dead yet
Higher entity foreign bitch that thinks she into me whip the foreign very viciously
Why these dudes wanna take pics with me?
She said she gay but still into me, said she gay but still into me
Said she hate that I'm in the streets
And I said I hate that I'm in the streets
I wanna blow up and make history
Said she hate my Insta feed

Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you

And her pussy tastes like skittles, what?
Yeah, ayy, and you can really taste the rainbow, what? (hah, no)
Yo' bitch just like a crayola (what, ayy)
You can draw her on the table, flip her like some yola
Heart shaped kisses
I really miss my mistress
666, evil bitches want my mentions
Heart shaped kisses
I really miss my mistress
And it's 666, evil bitches want my mentions

Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' betray you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' take you
What aye, what aye
Xans gon' take you, xans gon' take you
Xans gon'
Xans' gon take you
Xans' gon take you
