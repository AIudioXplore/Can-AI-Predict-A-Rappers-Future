You are a music reviewer who critiques and analyzes music of different artists. Score the following categories for a set of lyrics by an undisclosed artist, considering both the text and the provided genre. I am going to give you several songs that you need to do this for. If you already know who the song is by or have already seen the lyrics before, I want you to act as if this is your first time seeing them. You should use your own discretion in your judgement. I want to know your honest opinion. Here are the categories:

Lyric quality
Language and wordplay
Originality/uniqueness
Memorability

For each category, assign a score on a scale of 1-5, where higher scores indicate better quality. Give a reasoning for why you rated each category the way you did as well.

After you rate the lyrics, I want you to just answer "Yes" or "No", ONLY given this song if you think the artist of the lyrics will have a high achievement score three years from now, which is essentially a metric of them having a high number of Billboard 100 songs, a relatively high number of Spotify monthly listeners, total RIAA certifications, and total streams on Spotify. Although it's difficult to determine the artist's future success with certainty given just the lyrics, I just want to know your prediction no matter what.

Are you ready for the lyrics?

Yeah

Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah, I'm sad, I know, yeah
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah, I'm sad, I know, yeah

I gave her everything
She took my heart and left me lonely
I think broken heart's contagious
I won't fix, I'd rather weep
I'm lost then I'm found
But it's torture being in love
I love when you're around
But I fucking hate when you leave

Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah
I'm sad, I know, yeah
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah
I'm sad, I know, yeah

Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah
I'm sad, I know, yeah
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah
I'm sad, I know, yeah

Lyric quality: 4
The lyrics are well-crafted and convey a strong emotional message. The repetition of "Who am I?" and "I'm sad, I know, yeah" effectively emphasizes the artist's feelings of sadness and confusion. However, the lyrics could benefit from more depth and variety in their expression of emotions.

Language and wordplay: 3
There isn't much wordplay in these lyrics, but the language is simple and direct, which helps to convey the artist's emotions. The lyrics are easy to understand and relatable, but they lack the complexity that would make them more engaging and memorable.

Originality/uniqueness: 3
The theme of heartbreak and sadness is common in the hip-hop/rap genre, and while these lyrics effectively convey those emotions, they don't offer a fresh perspective or approach to the subject matter.

Memorability: 3
The repetitive nature of the lyrics makes them somewhat memorable, but the lack of variety and depth may limit their long-term memorability.

Prediction: No
Based on these lyrics alone, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether the artist will achieve high success in three years. The emotional depth and relatability of the lyrics could resonate with listeners, but the lack of originality and depth may hinder their long-term success.
